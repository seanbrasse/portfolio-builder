/**
 * Phase 0: the content, written before the layout.
 *
 * Every string here is real and sourced from Sean's resume. Nothing is
 * placeholder prose. When Phase 2 lands, this module is replaced by Supabase
 * queries returning the same shapes — that is the only change the rendering
 * layer should ever see, which is why the panels below reference content by
 * id rather than embedding it.
 *
 * Two deliberate absences, both of which are content decisions rather than
 * missing code:
 *
 *   1. `testimonials` is empty. The PRD's `approved` flag exists precisely so
 *      that a quote nobody has cleared cannot reach the page, and inventing a
 *      quote to fill a panel would be the single worst thing this project
 *      could ship. The testimonial panel is built and tested; it renders the
 *      moment a real, cleared quote is added here.
 *
 *   2. Project `images` are empty. Screenshots are the one input that cannot
 *      be derived from a resume. The image pipeline (duotone, focal point,
 *      theme response) is built; project panels render an inked blank until a
 *      file lands, which is COMP-4 behavior, not a broken state.
